# AMAZON_PRIME_SALES

INTRODUCTION

This repository contains powerBI analysis of Amazon Prime Sales .This project focuses on using powerBI to analyze sales, ratings, reviews, sellers performance, stock overviews etc.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

 - Looking at the sales overview dashboard,the revenues generated for sales per day stood at 5000 which is very poor considering the amount of sales amazon normally makes per day.
   
 - The number of reviews was actually competitive although it was not stated if its positive or negative,Seven out of the top 10 reviews where at the same level of reviews of 6.1k,Hudson baby topped the list with 9.9k against 10k maximum.
   
   - The inventory was not managed well because while the demands went up,most of the stocks were not replenished leading to low stock.
  - I encountered some challenges calculating sales overtime because the timeframe was not in the data given to analyse,so i assumed a value for sales per day  base on the total sales made.

    DATA SOURCE

    This data was gotten from my instructor in Dahel Techies by name Lesley Effiong,who taught me the basics in powerBI.This was sent as a powerBI project for all the cohorts  for the month.Originally,,it is a record of Amazon prime sales.

    SKILLS AND CONCEPTS

    I used powerBI desktop to analyse this data imported from excel spreadsheet and modelled adequately to suit my analysis.

    DATA ANALYSIS

    From the sales overview,the female wears and  baby accesories made a huge boost in sales without a significant increase in discount.
    There was a surge in sales leading to low stock in  the inventory.
    The discount sales caused increase in sales of some brands boosting their sales  volume.
    The products were rated with the men's T shirt being rated the most.
    In sales  by category,the wome n saree topped the list with 0.45m,followed by men's T shirt with a  percentage of 0.32m.Looking at the charts,the percentages of the brands continued to reduce.
    The analysis of tnhe sales made per cday was at 4216  per product.
    The total reviews made was at 551 thousand against 1million.
    The top 10 products with highest reviews are secret wish,shararat,AD&AV,Alan jones,Cheryl Fab,Monira,A.K creation,BE creative,Bronze and Saree with 8.1,7.0,6.1,6.1,6.1,6.1,6.1,6.1,5.9,5.9 respectively.I chose base on descending order.
    The ratings were shown to be in the same rate of 100% against 120%.
    The  product category,its brands and primes were also recorded accordingly in table format.
    The sellers and their performances were recorded with the highest performer(Cloudtail India) recorded at 158.
    The average sales were mostly delivered  by the merchants,few was delivered by amazon.
    Out of the 7864 sales made,half of it  were large,while the other was not large,giving the ratio of 1:1.
    Generally,the level of stock was recorded as 1000.

    VISUALISATION
    In the sales overview,sales by category shows variations of the diffeerent brands base on sum ,of sales.while some have the same number of sales,some increased while the others decreased.
    This creates a better vision of the highest sales made base on category as women saree.
    The image also references the total number of reviews for all the products per day.
    Everything that the sellers need to knllow about their sales has been highlighted in one visual.

    Thkis visual divides the image into two nhalves to showcase the number ,of large product sales frllom the non large with the stock level overview indicating result accuracy.
    The sellers performances were recorded using colours for easy identification,same withh the mode of deliveries.
    Creatkively combining visuals  and juxtapositioning the products helped to simplify visual reference of sales by amazon sellers.

    RECOMMENDATIONS

    From t he above analysis,i recommend that:

    - Sellers should use competitive pricing strategies,give discounts once in a while to potential buyers.
   
    - monkitor strategies used by other online vendors to boost sales.
   
    - They should pull in more re views by satisfied customers.
   
    - sellers should always review their performance by analyzing their sales data to understand what worked and what didn't,check customer feedback to identify areas for improvement.
   
    - Sellers should go for predictive inventory management software by keeping inventory at ideal levels to avoid bothoverstocking and stockouts.
